- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @peaceful03. I'm a student based in the UK.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m currently interested in and are persuing graphic design, photography, web design, videography and light coding. I do enjoy making interesting things for people to look at, even if it's weird or inhuman. In the future I mainly want to explore web design and photography because of my current sixth form and future university choices. By using github it will allow me to host web design files for convenience and future use.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to make apps in python, javascript and electron. Python is my main programming language because i've been learning it since the start of secondary school, how popular it is and the amount of modules and libraries to help expand a project. 
- ðŸ˜Š Most of my coding work is hosted here but is automatically set to private. Main reason being that none of it is finished, might not work on your system if you used it or is just not public just becuase of reasons.
- Thank you and have a good day!
